# Laravel-to-Go Roadmap: Transitioning from PHP to Go Backend Development

**Goal:** Leverage your Laravel/PHP knowledge to quickly become proficient in Go, focusing on **scalable, concurrent, and high-performance backends**.

---

## **Phase 1: Go Fundamentals (Week 1-2)**
**Objective:** Learn Go syntax and basic programming constructs.

- Go setup and environment (`go run`, `go build`, `go mod`)
- Basic syntax: variables, constants, types, loops, conditionals
- Functions and multiple return values
- Error handling with `error`
- Arrays, slices, and maps
- Structs and methods

**Mapping from Laravel/PHP:**
- Variables, functions, and control flow are similar to PHP.
- Structs in Go = PHP classes (for models/data objects).

**Exercise:** Build a mini-contact book using structs and slices.

---

## **Phase 2: Routing & HTTP Handling (Week 3)**
**Objective:** Handle HTTP requests and create APIs.

- `net/http` basics: server, routes, handlers
- Frameworks: `Gin` or `Fiber` for routing, middleware, and JSON handling
- Request parsing and response encoding
- Middleware implementation (logging, authentication)

**Mapping from Laravel:**
- Routes and Controllers -> Gin routes and handlers
- Middleware -> Gin/Fiber middleware

**Exercise:** Build a basic REST API with GET/POST endpoints.

---

## **Phase 3: Database & ORM (Week 4-5)**
**Objective:** Work with relational databases in Go.

- Connecting to MySQL/PostgreSQL
- Using `GORM` or `sqlx`
- CRUD operations with structs
- Transactions and query building
- Database migrations (using `golang-migrate`)

**Mapping from Laravel:**
- Eloquent ORM -> GORM
- Migrations -> golang-migrate or GORM auto-migrations

**Exercise:** Build a task manager with database persistence.

---

## **Phase 4: Concurrency & Queues (Week 6-7)**
**Objective:** Learn Go’s concurrency model.

- Goroutines: lightweight threads
- Channels: communication between goroutines
- Select statement, Mutex, WaitGroup
- Using concurrency for background jobs and queue processing

**Mapping from Laravel:**
- Laravel queues -> Goroutines + Channels / Asynq or go-workers
- Jobs & scheduling -> Goroutines + Cron jobs

**Exercise:** Implement a concurrent task processor.

---

## **Phase 5: Validation, Logging, and Error Handling (Week 8)**
**Objective:** Learn production-level coding standards.

- Validation: `go-playground/validator`
- Structured logging: `zap` or `logrus`
- Error wrapping and propagation
- Configuration management (`viper`)

**Mapping from Laravel:**
- Request validation -> struct validation
- Logging -> similar to Laravel log channels
- Exception handling -> Go’s error handling

**Exercise:** Add validation and logging to the task manager API.

---

## **Phase 6: Testing & CI/CD (Week 9)**
**Objective:** Write maintainable tests and integrate into pipelines.

- Unit testing: `testing` package + `testify`
- Benchmark testing
- Test coverage and mocks
- CI/CD integration (GitHub Actions / GitLab CI)

**Mapping from Laravel:**
- PHPUnit -> Go `testing`
- CI/CD pipelines -> similar concept, different syntax

**Exercise:** Write unit tests and benchmarks for the API.

---

## **Phase 7: Advanced Backend & Microservices (Week 10-12)**
**Objective:** Build scalable, concurrent backend systems.

- Dependency injection and package design
- Middleware, logging, caching
- Redis integration and caching strategies
- gRPC services
- Dockerizing Go apps
- Kubernetes basics for deployment

**Mapping from Laravel:**
- Laravel service providers -> Go packages + DI
- Redis caching -> same concept with `go-redis`
- Microservices -> Go microservices using gRPC or REST
- Docker deployment -> similar, just Go binary instead of PHP container

**Exercise/Project:**
- Build a scalable, concurrent backend API
- Implement background workers with goroutines and channels
- Containerize the API and deploy locally

---

## **Phase 8: Capstone Project (Week 13-14)**
**Objective:** Consolidate all learning into a real-world project.

**Requirements:**
- Must use Goroutines, Channels, REST/gRPC API, Database, Caching, Logging
- Include validation, error handling, and unit tests
- Containerized deployment

**Example Projects:**
- Real-time chat system with concurrent messaging
- Task scheduler with background workers
- URL shortener with high concurrency support

---

**Outcome:**
By the end of this roadmap, a Laravel/PHP developer should be able to:
- Build high-performance, concurrent backend systems in Go
- Apply Go best practices for maintainable and scalable code
- Leverage their Laravel experience for API design, database interaction, and deployment
- Transition efficiently into modern Go backend development
