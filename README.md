# Go Programming Syllabus for Beginners

**Goal:** A comprehensive beginner-friendly Go syllabus designed to take learners from setup to building concurrent, scalable backends, including exercises and a capstone project. It emphasizes practical skills recruiters and employers value.

---

## **Phase 1: Introduction & Setup (Week 1)**
**Objective:** Familiarize with Go ecosystem and environment.

- Introduction to Go: history, goals, advantages
- Installing Go and setting up the environment (Windows/Linux/macOS)
- Go tools overview: `go fmt`, `go build`, `go run`, `go test`, `go mod`
- Writing the first Go program (`Hello, World!`)
- Understanding Go workspace, modules, and package structure

**Exercises:**
- Install Go and setup IDE (VSCode/GoLand)
- Create and run a simple Go module

---

## **Phase 2: Basics of Go (Weeks 2-3)**
**Objective:** Learn Go syntax, types, and basic programming constructs.

- Data types and variables
- Constants and iota
- Operators
- Control flow: if, switch, loops
- Functions, multiple return values
- Error handling with `error`
- Arrays, slices, and maps

**Exercises:**
- Implement a basic calculator
- Create a mini-contact book using maps
- Practice exercises on slices, arrays, and loops

---

## **Phase 3: Advanced Data Structures & OOP Concepts (Weeks 4-5)**
**Objective:** Introduce structs, interfaces, and composition.

- Structs and methods
- Interfaces and polymorphism
- Embedding and composition
- Pointers in Go
- Packages and modular programming

**Exercises:**
- Implement a simple banking system with accounts and transactions
- Use interfaces to define different account types

---

## **Phase 4: Concurrency & Parallelism (Weeks 6-7)**
**Objective:** Master Goâ€™s core strength: concurrency.

- Goroutines: creating and running concurrent tasks
- Channels: buffered, unbuffered, directional
- Select statement for multiple channels
- Mutexes and WaitGroups
- Context package for cancellation and timeouts

**Exercises:**
- Build a concurrent URL fetcher
- Implement producer-consumer problem using channels
- Parallel processing of a large dataset

---

## **Phase 5: File I/O, JSON, and Networking (Weeks 8-9)**
**Objective:** Learn to handle data and network communication.

- Reading and writing files
- JSON encoding/decoding
- HTTP client and server basics
- Building a simple REST API

**Exercises:**
- Create a REST API with CRUD operations
- Read data from JSON file and serve via API

---

## **Phase 6: Testing, Error Handling & Best Practices (Week 10)**
**Objective:** Teach production-quality code practices.

- Unit testing with `testing` package
- Benchmark testing
- Error wrapping and handling
- Logging best practices
- Code formatting and linting

**Exercises:**
- Write unit tests for REST API
- Benchmark a function processing large data

---

## **Phase 7: Advanced Topics & Scalable Backend Design (Weeks 11-12)**
**Objective:** Apply Go skills to scalable backend projects.

- Dependency injection and package design
- Middleware in HTTP servers
- Caching strategies (in-memory, Redis)
- Working with databases (PostgreSQL/MySQL)
- Microservices patterns and gRPC basics
- Deploying Go applications (Docker, Kubernetes)

**Exercises/Projects:**
- Build a scalable task manager API
- Implement concurrent worker pool for task processing
- Containerize API with Docker and deploy locally

---

## **Phase 8: Capstone Project (Weeks 13-14)**
**Objective:** Consolidate learning in a real-world project.

- Design and implement a **scalable backend system**
- Must use: Goroutines, Channels, REST/gRPC API, Database, Caching, and proper error handling
- Include unit tests, logging, and README documentation

**Example Projects:**
- Real-time chat application with concurrent message processing
- URL shortener service with high concurrency support
- Task scheduler for distributed jobs

---

**Outcome:**
By the end of this syllabus, learners should be able to:
- Understand Go syntax and semantics
- Build concurrent and scalable backend systems
- Apply Go best practices for production-ready code
- Deploy Go applications using modern DevOps tools
